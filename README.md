CLColorPicker
=============

Color picker control which is similar to one that in original Mac applications like Numbers, Pages, Keynote. Original one has lots of small pictures.
This control based on NSSegmentedControl and has numbers of interesting things to know, so it's not just implementation but also good place to look how:<br/>
	- to subclass NSSegmentedCell<br/>
	- is working NSTrackingArea<br/>
	- create NSPopover<br/>
